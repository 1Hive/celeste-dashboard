 `yarn start` will launch the app, configured to connect to our Rinkeby deployment.
  
  For connecting to other chains / deployments, a few useful npm scripts are provided:
   - xDai: `yarn start:xdai` will launch the app, configured to connect to Celeste's xDai deployment
   - Local: `yarn start:local` will launch the app, configured to connect to the local devchain.

Other [configuration options](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) are also available.

### Local development:

In order to start the dashboard locally, you will need to setup a few processes first.
  - Start ganache devchain
  - Deploy contracts to devchain
  - Deploy subgraph instance

 _For a detailed guide on how to achieve this, see more instructions [here](https://github.com/1hive/celeste-subgraph)._

You can also setup the [court services](https://github.com/1hive/celeste-backend/tree/master/packages/services), which include some automation for penalty settlements and heartbeats.

To start populating Celeste with disputes, you can use the [CLI tool](https://github.com/1hive/celeste-backend/tree/master/packages/cli).
